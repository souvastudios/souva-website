# Welcome to Souva

In a world overflowing with digital noise, notifications, and endless distractions, we believe there's a better way. Welcome to **Souva** - your antidote to the chaos of modern technology.

## Our Mission

We're not just another tech company. We're craftspeople, digital minimalists, and advocates for your mental well-being. Our mission is simple yet profound:

> Build calm, thoughtful, and beautiful digital tools that respect your focus and privacy.

## The Problem with Digital Noise

Every day, we're bombarded with:
- Endless notifications demanding our attention
- Complex interfaces that prioritize engagement over usability
- Apps that harvest our data without adding real value
- Digital tools that increase anxiety rather than reduce it

This isn't sustainable. It's not healthy. And it's definitely not the future we want to build.

## Our Approach

### 1. **Intentional Design**
Every pixel, every interaction, every feature is carefully considered. We ask ourselves: "Does this add value to the user's life, or does it add noise?"

### 2. **Privacy First**
Your data is yours. We build tools that work for you, not advertising algorithms. Privacy isn't an afterthought - it's a fundamental principle.

### 3. **Focus Over Features**
We resist the urge to add features just because we can. Instead, we focus on doing a few things exceptionally well.

## Our First Piece: 84Diary

We're starting with something simple yet powerful - **84Diary**. It's a daily journaling app that challenges you to capture your entire day in just 84 characters.

Why 84 characters? Because constraints breed creativity. When you're forced to distill your day into its essence, you discover what truly matters.

### Key Features:
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean, distraction-free design
- **Daily Prompts**: Gentle nudges to help you reflect
- **Private by Default**: Your thoughts stay yours
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on iOS and Android

## Looking Forward

84Diary is just the beginning. We're planning a suite of tools that share the same philosophy:
- **Calm productivity** apps that reduce stress
- **Mindful communication** tools that foster genuine connection
- **Privacy-focused** alternatives to mainstream apps

## Join Our Journey

We're building more than software - we're building a movement. A movement toward digital minimalism, intentional technology, and tools that serve humanity rather than exploit it.

Follow our journey, try our tools, and help us create a calmer digital future.
